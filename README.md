# USV-MSOD
USV-MSOD: Unmanned Surface Vehicle Multi-Scene Object Detection Dataset
Overview
The USV-MSOD dataset is a comprehensive collection of images and annotations designed for the detection of small objects on the water surface under various scenarios and conditions. This dataset supports research and development in the field of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) by providing a rich source of data for training and testing object detection models.

Features
Diverse Scenarios: The dataset includes images captured in different weather, lighting, and sea state conditions.
Small Object Focus: It specifically targets the challenge of detecting small objects, which are often difficult to identify due to their size and the dynamic nature of the water environment.
High-Quality Annotations: Each image is carefully annotated with bounding boxes and labels, ensuring high accuracy and consistency.
